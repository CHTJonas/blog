# CHTJonas' Blog Software

Like every dev I've decided to reinvent the wheel and write my own blogging software. It's written in Go and should be fairly simple for others to understand and adapt for themselves should they so desire. The software is designed to be as simple as possible with the code being compiled to a static binary and the assets being baked in.
